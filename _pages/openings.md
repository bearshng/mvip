<!-- We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work on basic and applied research at the intersection of cybersecurity, control theory, and machine learning. 

You will take an acive role in determining the important and interesting research questions to tackle, creating novel scientific methodologies and tailoring them for specific practical applications, developing new adversary models and defense mechanisms, and evaluating the proposed methods on experimental setups.


**Note: Sometimes we do not have funding for additional PhD and postdoc positions. In those periods, we can only welcome you if you have a fellowship. We would be happy to support you after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [VR International Postdoc grant](https://www.vr.se/english/applying-for-funding/calls/2021-11-17-international-post-doc-grant-within-natural-and-engineering-sciences-spring-call.html) or the [Marie Curie Postdoc fellowship](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships).**
